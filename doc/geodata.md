# Geodata
The geodata files are used by the server to know the shape, boundaries and obstacles of the game world.
Using it is optional and prevents characters from walking/casting spells through walls and that kind of thing.

The files (.l2j) should be put in a folder called ```geodata``` inside the datapack folder.

The ```Geodata.properties``` defines the place that the server will look for those files, among other settings.
